I first learned about **AutoMapper** through work. And I was (still am) very impressed with how convenient of a tool **AutoMapper** is. But when I talk about **AutoMapper** to my friends,
they do not really know about it. If you are reading this, chances are you already know what an **AutoMapper** is. If you don't, welcome ðŸ’ª. Like any other tool, **AutoMapper** is just another tool.
And people say "Right tool for the right job". If it works for you and helps you to achieve something in your projects, then it is the right tool for you. However, especially in a dynamic language like **JavaScript** (in this case, **TypeScript**), an **AutoMapper**
might not really make sense for you. Here's a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/4tg69t/question_typescript_auto_mapping/) that discusses whether you'd want an **AutoMapper** for your **TypeScript** projects. There are also
a plethora of blog posts about "Why No AutoMapper?" and here's one that is really good in my opinion: [Why I Don't Use AutoMapper](https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/why-i-dont-use-automapper/)
