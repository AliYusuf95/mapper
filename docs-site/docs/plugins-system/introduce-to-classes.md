`@automapper/classes` is one of the official plugins of `@automapper/*` monorepo.

We've been using `@automapper/classes` since the beginning of the documentations, so it should be fairly straightforward. `@automapper/classes` works with TS/ES5 Classes

## Installation

```bash
npm i @automapper/classes
# or with yarn
yarn add @automapper/classes
```
