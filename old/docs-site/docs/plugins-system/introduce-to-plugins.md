`@automapper/*` utilizes a plugin-based approach to break up responsibilities away from the Core package. This is also to help with different mapping use-cases.

`@automapper/*` currently provides two official plugins:

- [@automapper/classes](introduce-to-classes.md)
- [@automapper/pojos](introduce-to-pojos.md)
- [@automapper/sequelize](introduce-to-sequelize.md)
