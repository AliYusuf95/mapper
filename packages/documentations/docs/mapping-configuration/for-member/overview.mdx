Call `forMember()` and pass in a `Selector` along with a `MemberMapFunction` to customize the [MappingTransformation](../../fundamentals/mapping#mappingtransformation) of a particular property on the `Destination`

    <img
        src={require('../../../static/for-member.gif').default}
        alt="ForMember gif to showcase developer experience"
    />
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>
            <code>forMember()</code> is strongly-typed, providing good developer
            experience with autocomplete
        </em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

:::caution

To iterate once again, if the Mapping has a lot of `forMember()`, it is time to re-evaluate the models.
